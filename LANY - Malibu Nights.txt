Somebody help is getting worse 
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up

NANANANA

I drive circles under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
Get this out my head

I DRIVE CIRCLES IN ON THE STREET LIGHTS 
NOTHING SEEMS TO CLEAR MY MIND I CANT FORGET
GET THIS OUT MY HEAD 
SO I DRIVE CHASING MALIBU NIGHT 
NOTHING SEEMS TO HEAL MY MIND 
I CANT FORGET
